Day 1 

My first day at GNDEC started at 8:30 a.m. I first went to the Gurudwara Sahib in the college, bowed my head, and listened to the peaceful Shabad Kirtan. It made me feel calm and happy. After the Ardaas, we were served tea, snacks, and refreshments.

From 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., I attended the induction program in the auditorium. Teachers and seniors welcomed us warmly and explained about the different courses, NCC, and other activities in the college. After a short break, the session continued from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., where teachers gave tips on scoring well in exams, performing in labs, and taking part in activities. It was a wonderful start to my college journey.

Day 2 

The second day began with an English Proficiency Test at 9:30 a.m., which ended at 10:30 a.m. This was followed by a Mathematics Proficiency Test from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Both tests helped check our skills before regular classes start.

After a break from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., we attended an expert lecture by Dr. Arashdeep Singh on “Food: A Pivotal Role in Students’ Overall Wellness” in the auditorium. The lecture was very interesting and showed how healthy food is important for both body and mind. The day ended with a session by the Causmic Club and the launch of induction activities from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. It was a day full of learning and inspiration.

Day 3 

The third day was exciting and different. From 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., we had an expert lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh, Incharge of IAPT, in the auditorium. He taught science in a fun and practical way by performing many experiments. All students enjoyed the lecture and learned science in a new way.

From 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., there was another expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni on “Universal Human Values.” This session was inspiring and taught us the importance of values in our personal and social life. Overall, the day was full of knowledge, excitement, and new experiences.
